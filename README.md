This project aims to address both food waste and food insecurity, often found in the same communities, by creating a solution that tackles both issues simultaneously. We plan to connect surplus food suppliers, such as local restaurants, grocery stores, and food producers, with individuals and families in need. By partnering with these suppliers, we'll collect food that is still good to eat but would otherwise be discarded and redistribute it to those who lack adequate access to nutritious meals.
